	<textarea id="input-text" rows="4">The wordcloud is often maligned as a visual layout. Raw frequencies without filtering stopwords and general loss of word context attribute to this negative stigma. In an attempt to provide a more insightful wordcloud, I have included a basic NLP technique to pick out action phrases in plain text. I'm no master in linguistics, but by using a pseudo-regex (verb, *, noun) we can detect phrases that serve as actionable highlights from a textbody. It's not perfect, but try it out with your own text!</textarea>

This demo includes the wordcloud layout from Jason Davies and Percy Wegmann's POS tagger. It's not perfect, but try it out with your own text! -->
